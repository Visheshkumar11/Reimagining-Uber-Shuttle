# 🚍 Reimagining Uber Shuttle: Enhancing the Commute Experience

## 📌 Overview
Uber Shuttle is a great initiative for urban mobility, but it still has some pain points. This project explores enhancements to the **Uber Shuttle** service, focusing on UI/UX improvements, seat selection, and smart alerts to create a more seamless commuting experience.

## 🤔 Problem Statement
Despite pre-booking a shuttle, riders often face issues such as:
- 🚏 **No guaranteed seating** due to a first-come, first-serve model.
- ⏳ **No smart reminders** to notify users before their destination.
- 🔍 **Lack of an intuitive booking system** to recommend optimal routes.

## 💡 Proposed Solutions

### 1️⃣ Smarter UI/UX for Seamless Booking 📲
- **Save Locations**: Allow users to save frequently used pickup and drop locations.
- **Recommended Routes**: Suggest routes based on past travel patterns.
- **Shuttle Routes Map**: View all available Uber Shuttle routes in Delhi-NCR for better planning.

### 2️⃣ Game-Changing Seat Selection Feature 💺
- **Enable Seat Selection** at the time of booking.
- **Enhance User Experience** by providing more control over the commute.
- **Boost Retention & Satisfaction** through a premium experience.

### 3️⃣ Smart Destination Alerts for a Stress-Free Ride ⏰
- **Reminder Alerts** before the shuttle reaches the user's stop.
- **Reduces Anxiety** as users don’t have to keep checking their location.
- **Enhances Efficiency** by ensuring riders never miss their stop.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Implementing a prototype app to showcase these features.
- Gathering user feedback for further refinements.
- Extending the solution to other shared mobility services.
